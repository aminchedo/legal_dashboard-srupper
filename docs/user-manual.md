# User Manual – Legal Dashboard Demos

## Accessing the Demo

- Always-on static frontend:
  - Open the GitHub Pages site published from this repository.
  - Click "Open Frontend" to view the UI. API features need a live demo.

- Live demo (public URL):
  - Go to GitHub → Actions → "Deploy Orchestrator (Smart Fallbacks)" → Run.
  - Wait 2–3 minutes. The live demo URL will appear in the logs and as an artifact HTML file.
  - Click the URL to open the dashboard.

## Sharing
- Copy the live URL and send it to others. It stays active for the session duration (up to 2 hours with ngrok, ~60 minutes with LocalTunnel).
- Re-run the workflow to renew the demo when it expires.

## Notes
- LocalTunnel may show a warning page; click Continue.
- ngrok provides HTTPS with professional domains.
- If the live demo is temporarily unavailable, the GitHub Pages static site is always an alternative for showcasing the UI.
