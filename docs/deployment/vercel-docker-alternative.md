# Vercel Deployment Alternative for Docker Application

## Current Situation
Your application is designed as a Docker container with:
- Python backend (FastAPI/Uvicorn)
- Frontend (React/Vite)
- Multi-container setup with Nginx, PostgreSQL, Redis

## Vercel Limitations
Vercel doesn't support:
- Traditional Docker containers
- Long-running processes
- Custom server configurations
- Persistent file systems
- Custom networking

## Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Use Docker-Compatible Platforms (Recommended)
Deploy your existing Docker setup to:
- **DigitalOcean App Platform** - Easy deployment, good pricing
- **Google Cloud Run** - Serverless containers, auto-scaling
- **Railway** - Simple deployment, good for full-stack apps
- **Render** - Free tier available, easy setup
- **Fly.io** - Global deployment, good performance

### Option 2: Restructure for Vercel
If you must use Vercel, you'll need to:

1. **Split the application:**
   - Frontend: Deploy to Vercel as static site
   - Backend: Convert to Vercel serverless functions

2. **Modify the backend:**
   - Convert FastAPI routes to Vercel API routes
   - Use serverless-compatible database (Vercel Postgres, PlanetScale)
   - Remove persistent file storage

3. **Update the frontend:**
   - Build as static assets
   - Update API calls to use Vercel function URLs

## Quick Start with Docker-Compatible Platform

1. **Build and push your Docker image:**
   ```bash
   ./docker-deploy-with-token.sh
   ```

2. **Deploy to your chosen platform:**
   - Use the image: `24498743/legal-dashboard:latest`
   - Configure environment variables
   - Set up custom domain

## Environment Variables Needed
Make sure to configure these in your deployment platform:
- `ENVIRONMENT=production`
- `DEBUG=false`
- `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1`
- `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1`
- Any database/API keys your app needs

## Next Steps
1. Run the Docker deployment script
2. Choose a Docker-compatible platform
3. Deploy using the pushed image
4. Configure environment variables and domain
