## üöÄ IMMEDIATE EXECUTION (Run These Commands)

### Option 1: Execute Master Script (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
./EXECUTE_DEPLOYMENT.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Commands
```bash
# Login to Docker Hub
echo "$DOCKER_TOKEN" | docker login -u "$DOCKER_USERNAME" --password-stdin

# Build and push
docker build -t legal-dashboard .
docker tag legal-dashboard ${DOCKER_USERNAME}/legal-dashboard:latest
docker push ${DOCKER_USERNAME}/legal-dashboard:latest

# Deploy locally
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name legal-dashboard ${DOCKER_USERNAME}/legal-dashboard:latest
```

### Option 3: Production Deployment Script
```bash
# Make executable and run
chmod +x docker-deploy.sh
./docker-deploy.sh production
```

### Option 4: Full Stack with Docker Compose
```bash
# Start everything (app + database + redis + nginx)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d
```

## üåê Access URLs (After Deployment)

- **Main Application**: http://localhost:8000
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:8000/health  
- **API Statistics**: http://localhost:8000/api/dashboard/statistics
- **API Activity**: http://localhost:8000/api/dashboard/activity

## üìä Your Docker Hub Image

- **Repository**: `${DOCKER_USERNAME}/legal-dashboard:latest`
- **Username**: `${DOCKER_USERNAME}`
- **Password**: `<your_dockerhub_access_token>`

## üîç Verification Commands

```bash
# Check if container is running
docker ps | grep legal-dashboard

# View application logs
docker logs -f legal-dashboard

# Test endpoints
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl http://localhost:8000/
```

## üõ†Ô∏è GitHub Actions Setup

1. Go to your GitHub repository settings
2. Add repository secrets:
   - `DOCKER_USERNAME` = your Docker Hub username
   - `DOCKER_TOKEN` = your Docker Hub access token (PAT)
3. Push to main branch to trigger auto-deployment

## üìã What Each File Does

### `Dockerfile`
- Multi-stage build (Node.js frontend + Python backend)
- Production optimized with security (non-root user)
- Health checks included
- 4 Uvicorn workers for performance

### `docker-deploy.sh`
- Intelligent deployment script
- Supports local and production modes
- Auto-cleanup of old containers
- Health verification and monitoring

### `docker-compose.production.yml`
- Complete production stack
- PostgreSQL database with initialization
- Redis caching
- Nginx reverse proxy with SSL support
- Automatic restarts and health checks

### `nginx.conf`
- Production-ready reverse proxy
- Rate limiting and security headers
- CORS support for API endpoints
- SSL configuration (ready for certificates)

### `EXECUTE_DEPLOYMENT.sh`
- Master script that does everything
- Step-by-step deployment with verification
- Automatic testing of endpoints
- Complete status reporting

## ‚ö° NEXT STEPS

1. **Execute deployment** on a Docker-enabled system:
   ```bash
   ./EXECUTE_DEPLOYMENT.sh
   ```

2. **Verify application** is running:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   ```

3. **Access your dashboard** at: http://localhost:8000

4. **Set up auto-deployment** by adding GitHub secret and pushing to main

## üéØ Quick Commands Summary

```bash
# ONE-COMMAND DEPLOYMENT
./EXECUTE_DEPLOYMENT.sh

# OR STEP BY STEP
echo "$DOCKER_TOKEN" | docker login -u "$DOCKER_USERNAME" --password-stdin
docker build -t legal-dashboard .
docker tag legal-dashboard ${DOCKER_USERNAME}/legal-dashboard:latest  
docker push ${DOCKER_USERNAME}/legal-dashboard:latest
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name legal-dashboard ${DOCKER_USERNAME}/legal-dashboard:latest

# VERIFY DEPLOYMENT
curl http://localhost:8000/health
docker logs legal-dashboard
```

## üîß Environment Limitation Note

The current environment doesn't support Docker due to kernel limitations, but all deployment files are ready. Execute these commands on any Docker-enabled system (local machine, server, or CI/CD environment).
